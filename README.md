# Snake

A semi-ortholinear keyboard with LEDs, rotary encoder support and spacebar options.

## Idea, PCB and original case by 1000eyes, just added another case option

This version is designed for FDM-printing. Especially the foot has 0.25mm parts in the front, so Resin will probably not work. I have only modified snake on the split spacebar Plate. Others are untouched but still compatible. Only added some fillets for visual appeal.
